This is a group project for Group 14

when running this code for the first time you'll have to remove the apostrophe (''') from the following code to create the sqllite 3database
'''
c.execute("""CREATE TABLE contactlist(
first_name text,
surname text,
contact_No text,
address text,
email text,
city text,
country text
)""")
'''
above is a sample of the code

when the apostrophe has been removed and the program ran for the first time, you have to put the apostrophe back unless the program wouldn't run,
because the command is to create a database which has already been created.
The ''' ''' acts as a comment
